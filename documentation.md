### Language purpose/genesis
1. Why was the language created?
* Swift: Programming language developed by Apple to use for ios devices.
* C#: Microsoft wanted to develop a OO language since it was becoming much more of an influence in computer programming. 


2. What problems was the language trying to address?
* Swift: Complexity of developing apps for ios. People wanted a easier way to code for ios than other preiously available languages.
* C#: Create a simpler version of complex languages. (C and C++)

3. Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?
* Swift: Create a more simple and elgant way to develop apps for ios instead of using other languages (objective c). Encorparates multiple functions from other languages.
* C#: Derived from C and C++

### Unique features of the language
1. Does the language have any particularly unique features?
* Swift: Completely compatible with objective (Use same APIs). You can use both languages in the same project.
* C#: Partial Classes - you can define a class in multiple files.

### Name spaces
1. How are name spaces implemented?
* Swift:
* C#:
  - Example: 
  using System;
  Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
  int i = Convert.ToInt32("123");

2. How are name spaces used?
* Swift: 
* C#:
