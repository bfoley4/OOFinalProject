### Types
 * Swift: Type annotations begin with a colon and end with a type.
 
       let someTuple: (Double, Double) = (3.14159, 2.71828)
       func someFunction(a: Int) { /* ... */ }
 
   - In Swift, there are two kinds of types: named types and compound types. 
     * Named type: Type that can be given a particular name when defined. Includes classes, structures enumerations, and protocols. In C#, instances of a user-defined class named Dog have the type Dog. The Swift standard library also defines many commonly used name types; arrays, dictionaries, and optional values.
     * Compound type: Type without a name, defined in the language itself. A compound type may contain two elements.
  
  * C#: Provides usual built-in types, custom types form libraries, value types, reference types, generic types.
